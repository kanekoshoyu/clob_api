# henlo: machine readable crypto exchange API doc in AsyncAPI YAML

there are way too many crypto exchanges and programming languages. we should try standardise the way we implement the exchange library.

I will add a bunch of AsyncAPI YAML here. In the near future I will set up a codegen that generates the rust exchange lib for python and crate for rust.
